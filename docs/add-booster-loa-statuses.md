# Add Booster and LOA Member Statuses - Completed

## Issue Fixed ✅
**Requirement:** Add two new member statuses: "Booster" and "LOA" (Leave of Absence). Boosters and LOA members are always exempt from squarehead duty.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### SQLite Schema (`backend/database/schema_sqlite.sql`)
```sql
-- Updated status check constraint
status TEXT DEFAULT 'assignable' CHECK (status IN ('exempt', 'assignable', 'booster', 'loa'))
```

#### MySQL Schema (`backend/database/schema.sql`) 
```sql
-- Updated status enum
status ENUM('exempt', 'assignable', 'booster', 'loa') DEFAULT 'assignable'
```

#### Migration Script
Created `backend/database/migrations/001_add_booster_loa_status.sql` to update existing databases.

### 2. Backend Changes

**Database Migration:** Applied migration to existing SQLite database to support new statuses.

**Sample Data:** Added sample users with the new statuses:
- Steve Booster (status: 'booster')
- Linda Vacation (status: 'loa')

**API Support:** The existing user endpoints already supported the `status` field correctly in the backend routes.

### 3. Frontend Changes

#### Members Component (`frontend/src/pages/Members.jsx`)
**Status Badge Display:**
```javascript
const getStatusBadge = useCallback((member) => {
  switch (member.status) {
    case 'exempt':
      return <Badge bg="warning">Exempt</Badge>
    case 'booster':
      return <Badge bg="info">Booster</Badge>
    case 'loa':
      return <Badge bg="secondary">LOA</Badge>
    case 'assignable':
    default:
      return <Badge bg="success">Assignable</Badge>
  }
}, [])
```

**Status Filters:**
Added filter options for Booster and LOA members in the members list view.

#### Member Edit Modal (`frontend/src/components/members/MemberEditModal.jsx`)
**Status Selection:**
Replaced the `is_exempt` checkbox with a proper status dropdown:
```javascript
<Form.Select value={formData.status} onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('status', e.target.value)}>
  <option value="assignable">Assignable</option>
  <option value="exempt">Exempt</option>
  <option value="booster">Booster</option>
  <option value="loa">LOA (Leave of Absence)</option>
</Form.Select>
```

#### Members Store (`frontend/src/store/membersStore.js`)
Updated filter logic to handle all four status types correctly.

### 4. Assignment Logic

**Automatic Exemption:** The assignment system already correctly filters members by `status === 'assignable'` in:
- `getAssignable()` method in User model
- `assignableMembers` filter in AssignmentEditModal
- Members store `getAssignableMembers()` method

This means Booster and LOA members are **automatically excluded** from squarehead assignments, just like Exempt members.

## Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Assignment Eligibility | Badge Color |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Assignable** | Regular members available for squarehead duty | ✅ Yes | Green (success) |
| **Exempt** | Members permanently exempt from duty | ❌ No | Yellow (warning) |
| **Booster** | Club boosters/supporters who don't dance regularly | ❌ No | Blue (info) |
| **LOA** | Members on Leave of Absence (temporary) | ❌ No | Gray (secondary) |

## Workflow Benefits

1. **Clear Classification:** Easy to distinguish between different types of non-assignable members
2. **Automatic Filtering:** Assignment dropdowns automatically exclude all non-assignable statuses
3. **Flexible Management:** Admins can easily change status without affecting other member properties
4. **Better Reporting:** Filter and view members by specific status types
5. **Intuitive Interface:** Color-coded badges make status immediately visible

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify New Status Options
1. Navigate to Members page using the development token
2. Click "Add Member" or edit an existing member
3. Verify the Status dropdown shows all four options:
   - Assignable
   - Exempt  
   - Booster
   - LOA (Leave of Absence)

### 2. Test Status Filtering
1. In the Members page, use the status filter dropdown
2. Verify you can filter by:
   - All Status
   - Assignable Only
   - Exempt Only
   - Booster Only
   - LOA Only

### 3. Test Assignment Exclusion
1. Create or edit a member with 'booster' or 'loa' status
2. Navigate to Next Schedule and try to edit an assignment
3. Verify that booster and LOA members do NOT appear in the assignment dropdowns
4. Only 'assignable' members should be available for selection

### 4. Verify Badge Display
1. View the Members list
2. Check that each status shows the correct colored badge:
   - Assignable: Green badge
   - Exempt: Yellow badge  
   - Booster: Blue badge
   - LOA: Gray badge

### 5. Database Verification
Check the sample data includes the new test members:
```sql
-- Should show members with all four status types
SELECT first_name, last_name, status FROM users ORDER BY status;
```

## Migration Notes

- **Development:** Migration has been applied to the SQLite database
- **Production:** When deploying to production with MySQL/MariaDB, uncomment and run the MySQL migration line in the migration script
- **Backward Compatibility:** Existing 'exempt' and 'assignable' statuses remain unchanged
- **Data Integrity:** All existing member data is preserved during migration

## Implementation Summary

✅ **Database schema updated** to support four status types  
✅ **Backend API** already supported status field correctly  
✅ **Frontend UI updated** with proper status selection and display  
✅ **Assignment logic** automatically excludes non-assignable statuses  
✅ **Member filtering** works with all status types  
✅ **Sample data** includes examples of new statuses  
✅ **Documentation** complete with testing instructions

The new Booster and LOA statuses are now fully integrated and functional, with automatic exemption from squarehead duty assignments.
