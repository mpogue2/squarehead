# Current Schedule Admin Edit Functionality - Completed

## Issue Fixed ✅
**Problem:** The promotion message mentioned being able to "continue editing assignments after promotion," but the Current Schedule view was read-only for everyone, including admins.

**Solution:** Added admin-only editing functionality to the Current Schedule view while keeping it read-only for regular members.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Admin-Only Editing Access
- **Members:** Read-only view (unchanged)
- **Admins:** Full editing capabilities for current schedule assignments

### 2. Enhanced User Interface

#### For Members (Read-Only):
```
Current Squarehead Schedule
Read-only view of current assignments
```

#### For Admins (Editable):
```
Current Squarehead Schedule  
Current assignments - click to edit

[Table Header: Click rows to edit assignments]
```

### 3. Interactive Table Features

#### Admin Table Row Behavior:
- **Clickable Rows:** Hover effect with pointer cursor
- **Edit Buttons:** Dedicated edit button in Actions column
- **Visual Cues:** "Click to assign" text for unassigned positions
- **Click Anywhere:** Can click entire row or specific edit button

#### Member Table (Unchanged):
- **Static Rows:** No hover effects or click handlers
- **Read-Only Text:** "Unassigned" for empty positions
- **No Actions Column:** Clean, simplified view

### 4. Assignment Editing Modal
- **Reused Component:** Same AssignmentEditModal from Next Schedule
- **Full Functionality:** Edit squareheads, club night type, notes
- **Validation:** Same validation rules as Next Schedule
- **Real-time Updates:** Changes immediately reflected in table

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Added editing state
const [showEditModal, setShowEditModal] = useState(false)
const [editingAssignment, setEditingAssignment] = useState(null)

// Added update mutation
const updateAssignment = useUpdateAssignment()
```

### Edit Handlers
```javascript
// Handle assignment edit (admin only)
const handleEditAssignment = (assignment) => {
  setEditingAssignment(assignment)
  setShowEditModal(true)
}

// Handle assignment save
const handleSaveAssignment = async (assignmentId, updateData) => {
  try {
    await updateAssignment.mutateAsync({ id: assignmentId, ...updateData })
    setShowEditModal(false)
    setEditingAssignment(null)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Failed to update assignment:', err)
  }
}
```

### Conditional UI Rendering
```javascript
// Dynamic table headers
{user?.is_admin && <th>Actions</th>}

// Row click handlers
<tr 
  className={user?.is_admin ? "cursor-pointer" : ""}
  onClick={() => user?.is_admin && handleEditAssignment(assignment)}
>

// Admin-specific action column
{user?.is_admin && (
  <td>
    <Button onClick={() => handleEditAssignment(assignment)}>
      <FaEdit />
    </Button>
  </td>
)}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### For Admins:
1. **Immediate Editing:** No need to go to Next Schedule for quick fixes
2. **Visual Feedback:** Clear indication that rows are clickable
3. **Multiple Entry Points:** Click row or edit button
4. **Contextual Help:** Updated footer text explains admin capabilities

### For Members:
1. **Clean Interface:** No confusing edit buttons or clickable elements
2. **Clear Status:** Simple read-only presentation
3. **Helpful Footer:** Explains how to request changes from admins

## Validation and Error Handling

### Assignment Updates
- **Member Validation:** Only assignable members shown in dropdowns
- **Conflict Detection:** Prevents double-booking same member
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error display for failed updates
- **Optimistic Updates:** UI updates immediately, reverts on error

### Permission Enforcement
- **Frontend Guards:** UI elements only shown to admins
- **Backend Security:** API endpoints still enforce admin-only access
- **Graceful Degradation:** Non-admins see clean read-only interface

## Updated User Flows

### Admin Workflow:
1. View Current Schedule
2. See assignment that needs updating
3. Click row or edit button
4. Modify assignment in modal
5. Save changes
6. See immediate update in table

### Member Workflow (Unchanged):
1. View Current Schedule
2. See all assignments clearly
3. Contact admin if changes needed

## Enhanced Footer Messages

### For Admins:
```
As an admin, you can edit current schedule assignments directly or use the Next Schedule page to plan future schedules.
```

### For Members:
```
This is a read-only view of the current schedule. Contact an administrator to make changes.
```

## CSS Enhancements

### Added Utility Class:
```css
.cursor-pointer {
  cursor: pointer !important;
}
```

### Table Row Styling:
- **Admin Rows:** Pointer cursor and hover effects
- **Member Rows:** Default cursor and styling

## Backend Requirements

### API Endpoints Used:
- **GET /api/schedules/current** - Fetch current schedule (existing)
- **PUT /api/schedules/assignments/{id}** - Update assignment (existing)

### Permissions:
- **Read Access:** All authenticated users
- **Edit Access:** Admin users only

## Benefits

### Operational Efficiency:
- **Quick Fixes:** Admins can immediately correct assignment errors
- **No Workflow Disruption:** Don't need to create new schedule for minor changes
- **Better User Experience:** Fulfills the promise made in promotion modal

### Consistency:
- **Unified Interface:** Same edit modal used across Next and Current schedules
- **Familiar Patterns:** Admin users already know how to use edit functionality
- **Permission Alignment:** Consistent with other admin-only features

## Implementation Status ✅
