### **🏗️ Technical Implementation:**

#### **Schedule Model Features:**
- **Date Calculation**: Automatic weekly assignment generation
- **Club Day Integration**: Uses club_day_of_week setting from club configuration
- **Fifth Week Detection**: Special handling for fifth occurrence weeks
- **User Name Resolution**: JOIN queries to include assignee names
- **Transaction Safety**: Database transactions for promotion process

#### **Assignment Generation Logic:**
```php
// Finds first occurrence of club day in date range
// Creates weekly assignments until end date
// Detects fifth week occurrences (e.g., 5th Thursday)
// Automatically sets club_night_type (NORMAL vs FIFTH WED)
```

#### **Database Structure Working:**
- **schedules table**: Schedule metadata with type (current/next)
- **schedule_assignments table**: Individual dance assignments
- **Foreign Keys**: Proper relationships to users table
- **Indexes**: Optimized queries for date ranges and schedule types

### **🧪 Live Test Results:**
