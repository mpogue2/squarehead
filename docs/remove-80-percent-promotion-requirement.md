# Remove 80% Assignment Requirement for Schedule Promotion - Completed

## Issue Fixed ✅
**Problem:** The Next Schedule view required 80% of assignments to be filled before allowing promotion to Current Schedule.

**User Impact:** Users had to assign squareheads to 80% of dance dates before they could promote a schedule, which was unnecessarily restrictive.

## Change Made

### Before:
```javascript
// Check if schedule is ready for promotion
const canPromoteSchedule = () => {
  if (!schedule || !assignments.length) return false
  
  // Check if at least 80% of assignments have at least one squarehead
  const assignedCount = assignments.filter(a => a.squarehead1_name || a.squarehead2_name).length
  return assignedCount >= Math.ceil(assignments.length * 0.8)
}
```

### After:
```javascript
// Check if schedule is ready for promotion
const canPromoteSchedule = () => {
  if (!schedule || !assignments.length) return false
  
  // Allow promotion regardless of assignment completion status
  return true
}
```

## Benefits of This Change

1. **Increased Flexibility:** Admins can now promote schedules at any completion level
2. **Workflow Improvement:** Allows for creating schedule frameworks that can be filled in after promotion
3. **Real-world Usage:** Sometimes you need to establish the schedule structure before all assignments are known
4. **No Loss of Information:** The promotion modal still shows completion statistics for informed decision-making

## Safety Features Retained

The promotion modal still displays:
- Total assignments count
- Complete assignments count  
- Partial assignments count
- Unassigned dates count
- Warning about replacing the current schedule
- Note about continuing to edit after promotion

## Current Promotion Requirements

Now the "Promote to Current" button will be enabled when:
- ✅ A schedule exists
- ✅ The schedule has at least one assignment (dance date)
- ✅ User has admin privileges

The 80% assignment completion requirement has been completely removed.

## User Interface Updates

- The "Promote to Current" button is now enabled based only on basic schedule existence
- All existing warning messages and statistics remain in the promotion confirmation modal
- Users can still see completion status but are not blocked by it

## Testing

To test this change:
1. Navigate to Next Schedule view
2. Create a new schedule with multiple dates
3. Leave most assignments unassigned (or assign just a few)
4. Verify the "Promote to Current" button is now enabled
5. Click it to see the promotion modal with all statistics displayed
6. Promotion should complete successfully regardless of assignment completion percentage

This change provides more flexibility while maintaining all the informational safeguards.
