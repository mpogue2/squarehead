# ✅ Next Schedule Assignment Update Issue - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem Description

In the Next Schedule page, when clicking the Edit Assignment button and selecting members, after clicking Save, the table view did not update accordingly to show the updated assignment. The assignment was being saved to the database successfully (as evidenced by the success toast), but the frontend table was not refreshing to display the new assignments.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a **field name mismatch** between the backend and frontend:

### Backend (Schedule.php)
The `getScheduleAssignments()` method was returning:
- `squarehead1_first_name` and `squarehead1_last_name`
- `squarehead2_first_name` and `squarehead2_last_name`

### Frontend (NextSchedule.jsx)
The component was looking for:
- `squarehead1_name` 
- `squarehead2_name`

This mismatch caused the frontend to always display "Click to assign" because the expected field names didn't exist in the API response.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (Schedule.php)

Modified the `getScheduleAssignments()` method to concatenate first and last names:

```php
public function getScheduleAssignments(int $scheduleId): array
{
    $stmt = $this->db->prepare("
        SELECT 
            sa.*,
            u1.first_name as squarehead1_first_name,
            u1.last_name as squarehead1_last_name,
            u2.first_name as squarehead2_first_name,
            u2.last_name as squarehead2_last_name,
            CASE 
                WHEN u1.first_name IS NOT NULL THEN CONCAT(u1.first_name, ' ', u1.last_name)
                ELSE NULL 
            END as squarehead1_name,
            CASE 
                WHEN u2.first_name IS NOT NULL THEN CONCAT(u2.first_name, ' ', u2.last_name)
                ELSE NULL 
            END as squarehead2_name
        FROM schedule_assignments sa
        LEFT JOIN users u1 ON sa.squarehead1_id = u1.id
        LEFT JOIN users u2 ON sa.squarehead2_id = u2.id
        WHERE sa.schedule_id = ?
        ORDER BY sa.dance_date ASC
    ");
    $stmt->execute([$scheduleId]);
    
    return $stmt->fetchAll();
}
```

Also updated the `updateAssignment()` method to return the same concatenated name fields.

### CORS Configuration Fix

Fixed CORS configuration mismatch:
- **Before:** Backend was configured for `http://localhost:5179`
- **After:** Updated to `http://localhost:5180` to match the actual frontend port

## ✅ Verification & Testing

### Test Case 1: Complete Assignment
- **Action:** Edited first assignment (Jul 2, 2025)
- **Assignment:** Alice Brown + Bob Wilson  
- **Result:** ✅ Table updated to show both names with "Complete" status
- **Statistics:** ✅ "1 Complete Assignment" counter updated correctly

### Test Case 2: Partial Assignment  
- **Action:** Edited second assignment (Jul 9, 2025)
- **Assignment:** John Smith (Squarehead 1 only)
- **Result:** ✅ Table updated to show "John Smith" with "Partial" status
- **Statistics:** ✅ "1 Partial Assignment" and "2 Unassigned Dates" counters updated correctly

### Development Login Bypass Verification
- **Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:8000/api/auth/dev-jwt?email=mpogue@zenstarstudio.com`
- **Result:** ✅ Returns valid JWT token for admin user when running on localhost

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Backend-Frontend Data Contract:** Ensured consistent field naming between API response and frontend expectations
2. **Real-time UI Updates:** React Query cache invalidation now properly triggers UI refresh
3. **Assignment Statistics:** Counters for Complete/Partial/Unassigned assignments update in real-time
4. **Development Experience:** CORS configuration matches actual port usage
5. **Admin Authentication:** Development bypass working for localhost testing

## 🔧 Technical Details

### React Query Integration
The existing `useUpdateAssignment` hook was already working correctly:
- ✅ API calls successful (`PUT /api/schedules/assignments/{id}`)
- ✅ Query invalidation working (`queryClient.invalidateQueries(['schedules'])`)
- ✅ Data refetching occurring (`GET /api/schedules/next` after update)

The issue was purely in the data format, not the update mechanism.

### Database Queries
Both methods now provide:
- **Individual fields:** `squarehead1_first_name`, `squarehead1_last_name`
- **Concatenated fields:** `squarehead1_name`, `squarehead2_name`

This ensures backwards compatibility while providing the expected field names.

## 🎉 Final Status

**The Next Schedule assignment update functionality is now working perfectly!**

- ✅ Edit Assignment modal opens correctly
- ✅ Member selection from dropdown works
- ✅ Save operation succeeds 
- ✅ Table view updates immediately with new assignments
- ✅ Statistics counters update in real-time
- ✅ Development login bypass working for localhost testing
- ✅ CORS configuration matches frontend port

The issue has been completely resolved and thoroughly tested.
